Given two integers as user inputs that represent the number of drinks to buy 
and the number of bottles to restock, create a VendingMachine variable that 
performs the following operations:

Purchases input number of drinks
Restocks input number of bottles
Reports inventory

VendingMachine.h contains the struct definition and related function 
declarations. VendingMachine.c contains related function definitions. 
A VendingMachine's initial inventory is 20 drinks.

Ex: If the input is:

5 2
the output is:

Inventory: 17 bottles
