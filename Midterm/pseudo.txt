Write a program that takes three integers as input: low, high, and x. The program then outputs the 
number of multiples of x between low and high inclusive.

Ex: If the input is:
1 10 2
the output is
5

// Does this include decimals? How are we handling remainders?

Repeat until the user enters ‘n’ or wants to quit the program.

If the user enters any negative number, output an error message and ask for the input again.

If low is not less than high, output an error message and repeat the program.

Hint: Use the % operator to determine if a number is a multiple of x. Use a for loop to test 
each number between low and high.



Welcome to my Midterm.
Enter 3 positive whole numbers - low, high, and x. This program then outputs the number of multiples of x between low and high inclusive. Please make sure low is less than high.
3 15 5
Number of multiples of 5 between 3 and 15: 3
Do you want to continue? (y/n): y

Enter 3 positive whole numbers - low, high, and x. This program then outputs the number of multiples of x between low and high inclusive. Please make sure low is less than high.
15 1 5
Invalid input! Low must be less than high!! Please try again.

Enter 3 positive whole numbers - low, high, and x. This program then outputs the number of multiples of x between low and high inclusive. Please make sure low is less than high.
13 45 9
Number of multiples of 9 between 13 and 45: 4
Do you want to continue? (y/n): n

Thank you for using my program!
