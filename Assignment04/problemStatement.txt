Sometimes you will see an activity at a fair where people are asked to guess how many jellybeans 
there are in a jar. Sometimes prizes are given to the person who guesses a number closest to 
the actual number. You can use a little math and write a program to solve this problem for any 
size jelly bean and jar!


Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to develop an algorithm and a working C program, to calculate 
the number of jellybeans in a jar, given the dimensions of a jellybean, and the capacity of the 
jar. 

Then you will output some statistics based on the information the user has entered. You will be 
entering in jar and jellybean dimensions, and you will continue asking the user for jar and 
jellybean dimensions until they are done. While the user wants to add more input, you will add 
the data to accumulators (an accumulator is a variable the program uses to calculate a sum or 
product of a series of values) to perform statistical analysis after they are done.

After completing this assignment you will be able to:
Use a do while loop to prompt the user for at least one set of jar and jellybean dimensions
Use an accumulator to keep track of the total number of jellybeans all the jars can hold, and then number of entries entered by the user
Use a min/max algorithm to determine the largest jellybean and jar size that contains the largest estimate of jellybeans
Calculate the average number of jellybeans the jars can hold
